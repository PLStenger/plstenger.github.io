excerpt: 'The capacity of marine sponges to cope with environmental changes is often attributed to the specific composition of their bacterial communities. In this study, we assessed the bacterial microbiome of two dominant sponges, Rhabdastrella globostellata (Rg) and Hyrtios erectus (He), living in the Bouraké lagoon (New Caledonia), where abiotic conditions daily fluctuate according to the tide. Sponge specimens, sediment and seawater samples were collected at 2–3 m depth. The bacterial communities were assessed using 16S rRNA metabarcoding, and variations between the two sponges were compared using PCA biplots. Chloroflexi was the dominant phyla in both He and Rg with an average relative abundance of 41.2% and 53.2%, respectively, while it was absent in sediment and seawater. Among the phylum Chloroflexi, SAR202 clade was dominant in both sponges, reaching an average relative abundance of 53.2% (He) and 78.7% (Rg). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the main variables driving the bacterial community structure in both sponges. The results indicated that the bacterial community structure in both sponges was strongly associated with Chloroflexi (70.9% of the phyla variance) and SAR202 clade (86.6% of the clade vari- ance). The high relative abundance of the phylum Chloroflexi and the SAR202 clade observed in this study is the highest reported so far in the literature in marine sponges. Such a high relative abundance of these bacteria could suggest their involvement in the well-being of sponges in the extreme environmental conditions of Bouraké.'
