**Abstract**  
The marine microbiome plays a vital role in coral reef ecosystems, influencing biodiversity and resilience. This study investigates microbial communities across three reef compartments (seawater, sediment, and coral rubble) at three environmentally contrasted sites on the Hermitage fringing reef of La Réunion Island. Using a multimarker high-throughput DNA sequencing approach (16S, 18S, ITS, and tufA), the research identifies microbial bioindicators linked to reef health. Key findings include seasonal and compartmental variations in microbiome composition, with significant taxa such as *Vibrio*, *Aspergillus*, *Ostreobium*, and *Symbiodinium*. These results provide actionable insights for reef management and conservation in the Western Indian Ocean.
