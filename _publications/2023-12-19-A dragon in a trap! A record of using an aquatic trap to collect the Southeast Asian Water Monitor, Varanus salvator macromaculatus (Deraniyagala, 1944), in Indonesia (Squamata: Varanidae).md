title: "2023-12-19 - A dragon in a trap! A record of using an aquatic trap to collect the Southeast Asian Water Monitor, <i>Varanus salvator macromaculatus</i> (Deraniyagala, 1944), in Indonesia (Squamata: Varanidae)"

excerpt: ' Monitor lizards of the genus *Varanus* face significant threats in the wild, with 74 of the 85 known species listed by the IUCN at various threat levels. Major threats to these lizards include habitat destruction, the global pet trade, human consumption, road mortality, and discarded items like food containers. *Varanus salvator macromaculatus*, a widely distributed semi-aquatic lizard in Southeast Asia, is currently listed as "Least Concern" by the IUCN. The study reports on field observations from Aceh Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, where water monitors are frequently caught using circular aquatic traps, which are primarily intended for crabs but also capture lizards. Local fishermen value the meat of these lizards, and they are widely consumed by the indigenous Nias people and traded for their leather in North Sumatra. The use of circular traps rather than conventional snare traps is a new finding for Aceh Province, highlighting additional threats to monitor lizards that have not been previously documented in the region. While monitor lizards are legally protected under Indonesian law, the hunting and trade of these animals raise concerns about the sustainability and legality of these practices, particularly in Sumatra. There is a need for updated research to assess the impact of these activities on monitor lizard populations, including the effects of novel trapping methods on non-target species and other herpetofauna. Addressing these concerns is crucial for informing conservation efforts and ensuring the sustainable use of monitor lizards, thereby preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems in the region.'
