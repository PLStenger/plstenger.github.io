Evaluating diffuse sediment contamination in the environment is a major concern with the aim of reaching a
good chemical and ecological state of the littoral zone. In this study the risks of chronic chemical contamination
and consequences in the bivalves Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus sp. and Mimachlamys varia were evaluated in coastal
environments. The objective here was to understand the anthropological phenomena that affect the functioning
of themarina of La Rochelle (semi-closed environment). Harbours seeking ecomanagement accreditations (such
as the international reference ISO 14001) constitute zones of interest to implement biomonitoring studies. The
biological effects of chemical pollution in the Marina of La Rochelle were studied to develop a multi-biomarker
biomonitoring approach on specific marine species of this site. Moreover, a genetic (DNA barcoding) approach
was applied to validate the species identity of collected bivalves. Of the three species tested the scallop, M.
varia, was the most sensitive to metal exposure.
