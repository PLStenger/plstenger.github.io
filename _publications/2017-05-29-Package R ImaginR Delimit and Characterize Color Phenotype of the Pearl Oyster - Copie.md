title: "Package R ImaginR Delimit and Characterize Color Phenotype of the Pearl Oyster"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Stenger2017
excerpt: 'The pearl oyster, *Pinctada margaritifera* (Linnaeus, 1758), is one of the only bivalves expressing a large varied range of inner shell color, and by correlation, of pearl color. This phenotypic variability is partly under genetic control, but also under environmental influence. This R package allow to to delimit and characterize their color variations (by the HSV color system) with pictures.'
