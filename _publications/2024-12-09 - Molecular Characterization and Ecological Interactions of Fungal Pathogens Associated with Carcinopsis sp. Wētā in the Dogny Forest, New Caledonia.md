**Abstract**  
Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are natural regulators of insect populations and play critical roles in ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the infection of Carcinopsis sp. wētā by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria malawiensis and the opportunistic pathogen Trichoderma uncinatum in the Dogny Forest, New Caledonia. Molecular characterizations revealed the ecological complexities and potential risks these fungi pose to endemic insect species. Results underscore the importance of monitoring fungal-host interactions to inform conservation strategies and biosecurity measures for New Caledonia and New Zealand.
