**Abstract**  
Soil health and One Health are global concerns, necessitating the development of refined indicators for effective monitoring. In response, we present the Anaconda R Package, a novel tool designed to enhance the analysis of eDNA data for biomonitoring purposes. This study applied the Anaconda package to examine the impact of different fallow lengths in fire-fallow cropping systems, using natural forests as a reference, on soil fungal and bacterial communities in Maré Island, New Caledonia. This paper underscores the importance of maintaining intrinsic microbial balance for effective disease suppression in agricultural systems.
