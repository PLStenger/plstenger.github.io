**Abstract**  
*Lacertoides pardalis* is a vulnerable skink species restricted to New Caledonia's ultramafic maquis shrublands, facing habitat loss due to mining. This study employs VHF radiotelemetry to assess the species' spatial ecology and social interactions. We monitored two populations, revealing significant home range overlap between sexes and a preference for rocky microhabitats. These findings highlight the importance of habitat preservation and provide a baseline for future conservation strategies, including translocation planning.
