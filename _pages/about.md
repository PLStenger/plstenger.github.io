I'm a PHD student in genomics and epigenomics on the University of French Polynesia, in Tahiti.
​
I work in Ifremer of Vaira'o on the color and the color variations of the pearl oyster *Pinctada margaritifera*.

The pearl oyster, *Pinctada margaritifera* (Linnaeus, 1758), represents the second
economic resource of French Polynesia. It is one of the only bivalves expressing a large
varied range of inner shell color, and by correlation, of pearl color. This phenotypic
variability is partly under genetic control, but also under environmental influence. In this
context, this thesis will allow to identify: 1) the genes expressed during the formation of shells
of contrasted colors; 2) the genetic variants associed with the expression of these colors; 3)
the mechanisms controlling the expression of chromatic plasticity in response to the
environment. In addition to the importance of these results for the pearl industry, this thesis
will favor the emergence of a new biological model for the multidisciplinary study of
pigmentation.

Is there a sampling map to show you the location of some sampling site:

Ialso had the opportunity to work on various biological model, such as dolphins (Bottlenose dolphin *Tursiops truncatus* (Montagu, 1821) during master 2 internship and Commerson dolphin *Cephalorhynchus commersonii* (Lacépède, 1804) during non-obligatory master internship),
alage (*Lobophora variegata* (Lamouroux, 1977) - during my license degree internship) and many bivalves (Mussels *mytilus edulis* (Linnaeus, 1758), Pacific Oysters *Crassostrea gigas* (Thunberg, 1793), scallop *Mimachlamys varia* (Linnaeus, 1758) during my master 1 degree internship (these 3 sp.), Macoma *Limecola balthica* (Linnaeus, 1758) during my engineer studies and the pearl oyster *Pinctada margaritifera* during this thesis)
