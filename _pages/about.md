I'm a PHD student in genomics and epigenomics on the University of French Polynesia, in Tahiti.
​
I work in Ifremer of Vaira'o on the color of the blackliped oyster Pinctada margaritifera that is the species that make pearl.
​
I grow up in New-Caledonia, and my passion about marine life began while I dived in the laggon. 
I'm really interested about marine population genetics,
marine taxonomy (teleosteans, algae, phanerogams, invertebrates...), ecophysiology and marine ecology.
As soon as I have time, I go to the sea to do apnea, subaquatic photography, or found animals/algae for my saltwater aquarium.
During my bachelor's degress internship, in Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), in Nouméa (New-Calédonia), I studied the Lobophora group (algae) and their relationship with corals and grazers.
I made experiments in independence (Laboratory and in situ) and with team. (PhD Christophe VIEIRA, internship Julie GAUBERT, HDR Claude PAYRI)
 
During my master's degress internship, in LIENSs (Littoral Environnement et Sociétés, UMR 7266 CNRS) laboratory in La Rochelle (France), I had testing correlations between genetic diversity and chemical pollution exposure in a bioaccumulating marine bivalve with Dr Amélia VIRICEL. Well, I used genetics kits for DNA extraction and I made PCR. I also do sequence cleaning with many softwares (Sequencher 4.7, PopArt, TranslatorX...) and made statisitcs with Arlequin and R.

I studied the population structure of Commerson dolphins of the Kerguelen islands with photo-identification on CNRS-CEBC (Centre d'etude biologiques de Chizé) with Dr Paul TIXIER.
 
During ma internship's master degree I worked with Dr Benoit SIMON-BOUHET (LIENSs, La Rochelle) and Hélène LABACH (GIS3M, Sausset-lès-pins) on the genetic population of botlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Mediterranean area. Well, I've used PCR, electrophoresis, plate sequencer (4300 DNA analyser), NanoDrop...
